# 🔧 Luna Project Refactoring Summary

## Overview
The Luna project has been reorganized to follow a clean, screaming architecture with proper separation of concerns.

## 📁 Key Changes

### 1. **Documentation Centralization**
- Created `docs/` folder with Nextra configuration
- Moved all documentation files from root to `docs/pages/`
- Set up Nextra for beautiful documentation visualization
- Organized docs with proper navigation structure

### 2. **Testing Consolidation**
- Created `monitoring/` folder for ALL testing and observability
- Removed `jest.config.js` from client and server folders
- Deleted `server/tests/` directory
- All tests now reside in:
  - `monitoring/jest/` - Unit and integration tests
  - `monitoring/playwright/` - E2E tests
  - `monitoring/grafana/` - Dashboards
  - `monitoring/loki/` - Log aggregation
  - `monitoring/prometheus/` - Metrics

### 3. **Deployment Simplification**
- Kept only ONE deployment script: `deploy-hostinger.sh`
- Removed all redundant deployment scripts and configurations:
  - `scripts/` directory (with multiple deploy scripts)
  - `docker-compose.digitalocean.yml`
  - `docker-compose.production.yml`
  - `docker-compose.simple.yml`
  - `docker-compose.hostinger.yml`
  - Various shell scripts

### 4. **Environment Configuration**
- Single `.env` file for all environment variables
- `env.example` as the template
- No multiple environment files

### 5. **Project Structure**
```
luna/
├── .env                    # Global environment variables
├── .env.example            # Environment template
├── README.md               # Main documentation
├── deploy-hostinger.sh     # Single deployment script
├── docker-compose.yml      # Docker configuration
├── package.json            # Root package.json with workspaces
├── client/                 # React frontend
├── server/                 # Node.js backend
├── lib/                    # Aspose.Slides local library
├── monitoring/             # All tests and monitoring
└── docs/                   # All documentation with Nextra
```

### 6. **Updated Cursor Rules**
- Modified `.cursorrules` to reflect new structure
- Emphasized test location (monitoring only)
- Clarified documentation location (docs only)
- Reinforced single deployment script policy

### 7. **Cleaned Root Directory**
Removed the following files:
- Multiple deployment scripts
- Test configuration files
- Redundant documentation
- Build and pre-deployment checks
- Various utility scripts

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Clearer Structure**: Each folder has a single, clear responsibility
2. **Easier Navigation**: Screaming architecture makes it obvious where things belong
3. **Simplified Deployment**: One script to rule them all
4. **Centralized Testing**: All tests in one place with proper organization
5. **Better Documentation**: Nextra provides a beautiful, searchable documentation site

## 📝 Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` in root to set up workspaces
2. Run `npm install` in `docs/` to set up Nextra
3. Run `npm install` in `monitoring/` to set up testing tools
4. Access documentation at `http://localhost:3000` (when running `npm run dev:docs`)
5. Deploy to production with `./deploy-hostinger.sh`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- The `.env` file is sacred - never modify directly
- All tests must go in `monitoring/` folder
- All documentation must go in `docs/` folder
- Use only `deploy-hostinger.sh` for deployment
- Docker is the only supported development environment
